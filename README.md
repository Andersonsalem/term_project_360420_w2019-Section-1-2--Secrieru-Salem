# Term Project Sample Repository

Use this repository to structure your term project submission.

There are three folders:
 - *bin*: where you put your code
 - *data*: where you put any data that you generate, or that your code relies on for validation of your results
 - *report*: where you put files related to your final report

 Each folder has its own README.md, where you can include extra documentation for the reader.
